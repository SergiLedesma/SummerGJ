Summary:
We’ve developed a multiplayer game like it was played before, two players in one keyboard. It’s a round based action game in 2.5D where the goal is to kill the other player with different weapons and getting passive stats when getting hit.
 
Theme:
We’ve interpreted the theme as a way to look at the good side of the bad things that can happen. That’s why, in the game, if you lose hp you earn a reward based on your missing health, so the less hp you have the more rewards you can stack up with a higher impact on your gameplay. Chances of comebacks are high ;)
